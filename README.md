- [native-image-kotlin-dsl-gradle](templates/native-image-kotlin-dsl-gradle) - A Gradle build script, written with the Kotlin DSL, that I use as a baseline for most Java projects I start. It provides support for [GraalVM's native image](https://www.graalvm.org/22.0/reference-manual/native-image/) as well.
